# Data-Analysis-Project

## Background

During the summer break between my first and second year of study at City, University of London, I voluntarily decided to build on a mathematics coursework assessment I completed during my final year of secondary school.

## Information about the original maths project

The coursework assessment incorporated my love for K-pop (South Korean pop music). In this assessment, I attempted to mathematically analyse the relationship between the proportion of Latin Script lyrics in K-pop songs and a the number of views their official music video (or if the song lacked one another YouTube video) received.

## How I expanded on the original project

Over the summer break, I expanded on this assessment by not only doing mathematical calcuations but coding mathematical calculations in Java. In this Java Project, I analysed the relationship between the proportion of Latin Script lyrics in K-pop songs and a the number of views seven times, one time speifically for each of the seven K-pop groups that I individually analysed.

## How the data was obtained and what was done with it

The data I used was obtained from a database. For each K-pop group, the Pearson's r, Regression slope and Regression intercept was determined, in addition to the data values for each song produced by the group. The data for each group was put into a specific data file for a specific group. After completing the data files, I used the information in each of the data files to graph the data in python using a scatterplot using a library called matplotlib. The python code for the graph can be found in the source directory (titled "Graph.py")

## The value of this project

This project gave me practice in data analysis skills and thus the project gave me an insight into the real life applications of computer programming.
